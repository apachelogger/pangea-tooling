Usage: jenkins_poll.rb 'regex'

Tells jenkins to poll for any changes and start the job if they are found.

regex must be a valid Ruby regular expression matching the jobs you wish to
retry.

e.g.
  • All build jobs for vivid and utopic:
    '^(vivid|utopic)_.*_.*src'

  • All unstable builds:
    '^.*_unstable_.*src'

  • All jobs:
    '.*src'

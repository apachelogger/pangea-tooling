      # Apparently the AUFS backend is a bit meh and craps out randomly when
      # removing a container. To prevent this from making a build fail two
      # things happen here:
      # 1. sleep 5 seconds before trying to kill. This avoids an apparently also
      #    existing timing issue which might or might not be the root of this.
      # 2. catch server errors from remove and turn them into logable offences
      #    without impact. Since this method is only supposed to be called from
      #    {run} there is no strict requirement for the container to be actually
      #    removed as a subsequent containment instance will attempt to tear it
      #    down anyway. Which might then be fatal, but given the 5 second sleep
      #    and additional time spent doing other things it is unlikely that this
      #    would happen. Should it happen though we still want it to be fatal
      #    though as the assumption is that a containment always is clean which
      #    we couldn't ensure if a previous container can not be removed.

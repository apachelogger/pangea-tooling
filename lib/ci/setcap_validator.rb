        Unallowed call to: setcap #{argv.inspect}
        setcap must not be called. Build containers are run without a whole
        bunch of privileges which makes setcap non functional!
        Additionally, setcap uses xattrs which may not be available on the
        installation file system. Instead you should introduce a postinst
        call matching the setcap call with a fallback to setuid.

        A number of setcap calls were expected but didn't actually happen.
        This is indicative of the build no longer needing setcap. Check the code
        and if applicable make sure there no longer are postinst calls to setcap
        or setuid.

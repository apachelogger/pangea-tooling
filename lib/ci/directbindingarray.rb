  # Helper class for direct bindings.
  # Direct bindings are simply put absolute paths on the host that are meant
  # to be 1:1 bound into a container. Binding into a container requires the
  # definition of a volume and the actual binding map, both use a different
  # format and are more complex than a simple linear array of paths.
  # DirectBindingArray helps with converting a linear array of paths into
  # the respective types Docker expects.

    # Helper for binding candidates with colons.
    # Bindings are a bit tricky as we want to support explicit bindings AND
    # flat paths that get 1:1 mapped into the container.
    # i.e.
    #   /tmp:/tmp
    #      is a binding map already
    #   /tmp/CI::ABC
    #      is not and we'll want to 1:1 bind.
    # To tell the two apart we check if the first character after the colon
    # is a slash (target paths need to be absolute). This is fairly accurate
    # but a bit naughty code-wise, unfortunately the best algorithmic choice
    # we appear to have as paths can generally contain : all over the place.
    # Ultimately this is a design flaw in the string based mapping in Docker's
    # API really.

# IMPORTANT SHIT AHEAD
# Do not use gems from git. Ever. It's incompatible with how we deploy the
# tooling and containerization in general.
# Instead what we do is run a secondary system that builds gems from git.
# https://github.com/pangea-project/pangea-geminabox
# To add a new job edit the Jenkinsfile in that repo instead.
# You can also add them here as ultimately the geminabox tech will use this
# file to emulate bundler's behavior.
# DO NOT EVER list a git: gem in the regular Gemfile. NOT EVER!

# Removing git builds:
# To roll back form a git build to a regular gem from rubygems.org:
#  - make sure the rubygems version is in fact > than what we have on
#    https://gem.cache.pangea.pub If it is not we cannot migrate automatically!
#    You can still go ahead but beware that the previously built gem will only
#    rotate out of our systems once the rubygems version has a higher version.
#  - drop the line below
#  - drop the relevant bit from pangea-geminabox and make sure that builds!
#  - gem fetch --clear-sources --source https://gem.cache.pangea.pub $NAME
#  - if the previous command went correctly there should now be the version
#    from rubygems in the cache at https://gem.cache.pangea.pub if not theres a
#    blocking problem with the cache update that needs resolving.

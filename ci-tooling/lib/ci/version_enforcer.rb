  # Helper to enforce that the Debian epoch version did not change in between
  # builds without approval from someone.
  # The enforcer loads previous version information from a record file
  # and then can be asked to #{validate} new versions. Failing validation
  # raises UnauthorizedChangeError exceptions!
  # Validation fails iff the epoch between the recorded and validation version
  # changed... At all. The only way to bypass the enforcer is to have no
  # last_version in the working directory.

let it pass by deleting the last_version marker of this job.

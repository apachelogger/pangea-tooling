CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindKF5Package.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "KF5Package", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "KF5Package" with any of
  the following names:

    KF5PackageConfig.cmake
    KF5Package-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "KF5Package" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "KF5Package_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "KF5Package"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

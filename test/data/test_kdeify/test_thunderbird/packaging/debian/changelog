  * Switch to comm-esr38
    - update debian/config/branch.mk
  * Don't hardcode -mfloat-abi=softfp in libvpx
    - add debian/patches/dont-hardcode-softfp-on-armhf.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Drop debian/patches/no_neon_on_arm.patch. This shouldn't beneeded
    anymore, because:
    - since it was added, most code that uses NEON intrinsics and assembly
      code using NEON instructions is disabled if the target is < armv7
    - Code that uses NEON intrinsics, when compiled, is hidden behind a
      runtime check (so doesn't run on systems that don't support those
      instructions).
    - Code in media/libvpx unconditionally compiles code that uses NEON
      intrinsics anyway, even if the target is < armv7 (but the code is
      compiled with -march=armv7-a and is hidden behind a runtime check for
      NEON support)
  * Refresh patches
    - update debian/patches/dont-include-hyphenation-patterns.patch
    - update debian/patches/unity-menubar.patch
  * Don't try to download python-blessings from the network - use the in-tree
    copy
    - add debian/patches/dont-install-blessings-from-network.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Add Welsh, Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian language packs
  * Disable all of the testsuite related patches and don't install anything
    in to the testsuite package for now. The patches have all bit-rotted,
    we're not running any tests and nobody is driving that anymore
  * Don't clone the nightly profile from the default profile at startup
    - update debian/thunderbird.sh.in
  * Don't use --with-app-basename to create the co-installable nightly build
    as it's not useful anymore, and changing the application name to
    "Thunderbird-Trunk" has always been problematic for code / addons that check
    the appname. Continue to use --with-app-name as before (which just changes
    the install name and the remoting name), and add a patch to introduce
    --with-app-profile, which allows us to change the profile location
    - update debian/build/rules.mk

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 3.5.1
    - Fix LP: #1051152 - Crash in nsIContent::SetAttr
    - Improve handling of radio items, and work correctly for radio items
      without a name
    - Stop causing nested DOM mutations. There is a big warning about doing
      this in nsIMutationObserver.h
    - Delay processing of DOM mutations during code sections when we are
      dispatching events. This should prevent a recurrence of
      reentrancy-triggered crashes such as LP: #1025011, LP: #1035305 and
      LP: #1051152, which have been exposed by updates of third-party addons
      recently and caused because our view of the menu changes during
      event delivery
  * Update messagingmenu extension to 1.0
    - Ignore case when comparing email addresses (thanks Tom Jaeger)
    - Stop using nsIMsgMessageService.streamHeaders, as this doesn't work
      reliably all of the time (and has been triggering a crash too)

  [ Chris Coulson <chris.coulson@canonical.com> ]
  * Update globalmenu-extension to 3.4.1

    - Add support for libmessaging-menu (thanks Lars Uebernickel)
      LP: #1040259
    - Properly disconnect from gobject signals. Even though our signal
      handlers are implicitly disconnected when we drop the last reference

      if we don't explicitly disconnect, due to the way that they are

thunderbird (15.0~b3+build1-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * New upstream release from the beta channel (THUNDERBIRD_15_0b3_BUILD1)

  [ Chris Coulson <chris.coulson@canonical.com> ]
  * Update globalmenu-extension to 3.4 prerelease r435
    + Fixes for LP: #1025011 - HUD search crashes Firefox when Firebug
      is installed
      - Provide our own binding for menupopup nodes which derives from the
        default binding and makes the "state" property work as if there
        were a frame
      - Make all menu nodes reference counted, and hold a strong ref when
        dispatching events, in case the event results in the removal of menu
        nodes
    + Keep the menu we export in sync with the document tree all of the
      time, rather than only when the menus are on screen. The HUD likes to
      open submenus without opening any of its ancestors, which can result in
      us handling events on menu nodes that are no longer in a document
      if an ancestor responds to a bubbled-up event by removing its
      children
    + Ensure we always null check the result of nsIDocument::GetCurrentDoc
    + When tearing down a menu, make sure that we empty out our DbusmenuMenuitem
      in case the parent reuses that item for another menu. Fixes a memory leak
      and an issue where Firebug menu items are duplicated indefinitely each
      time a menu is opened
  * Update eds extension to 0.5 prerelease r141
    - Lots of refactoring
    - Added proper support for evolution-data-server 3.6. It actually
      works now
    - Make contact list commit async
    - Fix LP: #919612 - cannot write contact, with "Could not save nsIAbEDSCard 
      property: SecondEmail" errors in the error console
    - Make setting dates work as expected
    - When selecting a generic image, clear the actual image property rather
      than saving the generic image pixel data to EDS
    - Ensure that phone numbers are displayed in the preview pane for EDS
      contacts
    - Use the upstream chat tab for managing IM handles. This requires
      Thunderbird 15
    - Ensure that chat handles appear in the contact preview pane
    - Make the preferred mail format option work (was always disabled in
      the edit UI)
    - Support storing Google Talk ID's in eds
    - Support Twitter as an IM account type (new in eds 3.6)
    - Implement nsAbEDSCard.deleteProperty
    - For number fields, handle the case where the passed in value converts
      to NaN
    - Implement nsAbEDSCard.copy and make nsAbEDSDirectory.addCard use this
    - Ensure we dispatch a notification when a directory name changes
    - Implement nsAbEDSDirectory.modifyCard and hide nsAbEDSCard.commit
    - Make contact list creation work properly
    - Display the year field in the contact editor for the anniversary date.
      This is supported fine by eds
    - Make copying contacts between EDS and non-EDS addressbooks work more
      reliably, rather than dropping fields such as PrimaryEmail
    - When copying a Thunderbird contact to an EDS folder, add the Thunderbird
      custom fields as "X-THUNDERBIRD-CUSTOM-*" vcard properties, rather than
      adding them to the note field
    - Don't unload libraries on shutdown. May fix a common shutdown crash

thunderbird (12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) precise-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release (THUNDERBIRD_12_0_1_BUILD1)
    - see LP: #987305 for USN information

  * Update globalmenu-extension to v3.2.3
    - Fix regression introduced by the fix for LP: #915888
  * Call xvfb-run with "-a" in case there are other servers running on the
    builder
    - update debian/build/testsuite.mk
  * Thunderbird recommends libcanberra0 now that bmo: #635918 has landed
    (LP: #732572)
    - update debian/control{,in}
  * Refresh patches
    - update debian/patches/avoid-dbus-roundtrip-for-httpchannel.patch
    - update debian/patches/no-sps-profiler-on-unsupported-archs.patch
  * Drop patches fixed upstream
    - remove debian/patches/ctypes-callback-reentry-fix.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Drop the version number from the install path, like we've done for Firefox
    - update debian/rules
    - update debian/thunderbird-dev.install.in
    - update debian/thunderbird-dev.links.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.dirs.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.links.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.lintian-overrides.in
  * Fix LP: #939652 - Web search functionality is broken in Ubuntu builds.
    Ship the localized Opensearch plugins in distribution/searchplugins.
    Also add a patch to use the locale of the global chrome package to
    select the search locale, like we do with Firefox. Add another patch
    to fix various bugs in webSearchProvider.js (see bmo: #733802)
    - add debian/patches/distro-locale-searchplugins.patch
    - add debian/patches/websearchprovider-fixes.patch

    - update debian/thunderbird.dirs.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.install.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.links.in
    - update debian/vendor.js
  * Make the language packs Architecture: any. Whilst they are actually
    architecture independent, we do install them in to /usr/lib (as the
    extensions location is shared with architecture-specific extensions).
    This also avoids the problem of offering incompatible language pack
    upgrades to users on architectures where Thunderbird fails to build
    (I'm looking at you, powerpc)
    - update debian/control.langpacks
    - update debian/control.langpacks.unavail
    - update debian/rules
    - refresh debian/control
  * Disable fix-build-failure-without-yarr-jit.patch, as it needs some work.
    This means that there is currently no powerpc support

thunderbird (11.0.1+build1-0ubuntu2) precise; urgency=low

  [ Chris Coulson <chris.coulson@canonical.com> ]
  * Update globalmenu-extension to 3.2
    - Fix LP: #915888 - Formatting toolbar menu entry is inverted
    - Make uGlobalMenu::RemoveMenuObjectAt work correctly when removed items
      are not contiguous
    - Don't try to recycle an item that wasn't a separator as an item that is
      a separator, as this breaks the menu (we already ensured that the reverse
      of this couldn't happen)
  * Add Keywords entry to desktop file (LP: #973394)

thunderbird (11.0.1+build1-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release (THUNDERBIRD_11_0_1_BUILD1)
    - Fixes LP: #962631, LP: #971578

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 3.1
    - Reduce our memory footprint a bit, which wasn't really a lot anyway
    - Avoid the use of the component manager for accessing commonly used
      services, where "commonly used" means "accessed when building every
      menu item". This should save some CPU cycles when building or
      refreshing menus
    - Try to recycle menuitems when they are removed from a menu by
      adding contiguous blocks of removed items to a "free list" which
      is emptied asynchronously, and reusing the items in this list when
      new items are added in place of the removed items. This means that
      menus which fully refresh on opening no longer alter the menu
      structure, but instead just update properties on existing nodes.
      This has a few benefits:
      + With no layout changes, unity-panel-service doesn't request
        the entire menu structure, which significantly reduces dbus traffic
        and makes it much faster to refresh the menu contents
      + The size of the menu doesn't change when it is refreshed, which
        eliminates the flicker that used to occur when opening some menus
      + The HUD can refresh our menus now without triggering layout updates
        (assuming that menu layout really hasn't changed)
    - Remove all use of the global observer service for sending our own
      internal notifications around
    - Get rid of a static initializer
    - Don't support older than Thunderbird 11
    - Fix some GError leaks
    - Hide the internal menu when creating a native menu, rather than
      waiting for confirmation that the native menu is registered
      successfully. We don't try to create a native menu if we don't
      find a menu service to register the menu with anyway
    - Keep menu contents updated whilst the menu is open, rather than
      just whilst it is opening

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 2.0.4
    - Add support for Thunderbird 12
    - Ensure we correctly hide dummy menu items
  * Fix LP: #915895 - Just set autoDisableScopes to 0. Other distributions
    are already doing this, and we already made this feature pretty much
    useless by allowing extensions in the application directory, so that our
    language packs aren't disabled by default
    - update debian/vendor.js
  * Fix LP: #939657 - Don't call g_settings_new each time we create a HTTP
    channel. Doing this causes a dbus roundtrip, and results in us spamming
    the session bus and dbus-daemon using lots of CPU when updating mailboxes
    - add debian/patches/avoid-dbus-roundtrip-for-httpchannel.patch

    - update debian/build/create-tarball.py
  * Always set the update channel - not setting it at build-time on release
    builds breaks the extensions.checkCompatibility pref. The only things
    using it at runtime are nsBlocklistService, Test Pilot (beta + aurora)
    and the about dialog (where the channel is hidden anyway)
    - update debian/rules

    a hard runtime requirement on this from Firefox 12 anyway, and this
    keeps us closer to the upstream configuration
    - update debian/config/mozconfig.in

    backgrounds. Should also fix LP: #856939

    - Don't spawn a new Thunderbird instance when being activated from the

      the nsIWindowMediator and nsIWindowWatcher interfaces directly
    - Don't keep the main window in the scope of our shared JS module, as
      we're probably going to leak it. Instead, use nsIWindowMediator to
      find the main window when we need it (eg, to switch tabs). Also, use

thunderbird (8.0~b2+build1-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release from the beta channel (THUNDERBIRD_8_0b2_BUILD1)

  * Update messagingmenu-extension to 0.8.1
  * Update eds extension to 0.3.8 (r96)
    - Fix LP: #872639 - Cannot open book: Could not create DesktopcouchSession
      object. Don't display errors from evolution-data-server for now, as
      they make Thunderbird unusable. Note, this doesn't fix the actual bug
      with desktopcouch
    - Fix LP: #863150 - Endless loop with password prompt
  * Provide a useful error message when trying to build the source package
    with an out of date control file
    - update debian/rules
  * Provide a way to prevent the source package from being built if the list
    of shipped locales changed upstream. Note that this is disabled on
    nightly and aurora
    - update debian/rules
    - add debian/extract-file.py
  * Move custom scripts to debian/scripts
    - move debian/get-xpi-id.py to debian/scripts/get-xpi-id.py
    - move debian/refresh-supported-locales.pl to
       debian/scripts/refresh-supported-locales.pl
    - move debian/extract-file.py to debian/scripts/extract-file.py
    - update debian/rules
  * Shrink the default mozconfig right down so that we use mostly upstream
    defaults, rather than overriding them with our own options. It is still
    possible to override them though. We also drop the pkg-config checks in
    debian/rules which allowed a fallback build configuration when dependencies
    aren't satisfied. Really, the build should just fail here rather than
    continuing in some undesirable fallback mode
    - update debian/thunderbird-dev.links.in 
    - update debian/mozconfig.in
    - update debian/control.in
    - update debian/rules
  * Refresh build-depends, as this hasn't been done for a while:
    - Drop patchutils, libxft-dev, libxinerama-dev, libgnome2-dev, sharutils
      and bzip2. These don't appear to be needed
    - Drop liborbit2-dev - only appears to be required if there is no libidl
    - Add libglib2.0-dev, libext-dev, libfontconfig1-dev and libpango1.0-dev,
      as the configure script checks for these directly
    - Add minimum versions to libgconf2-dev, libgnomevfs2-dev, yasm and
      libgnomeui-dev
    - Specify minimum versions for libnspr4-dev, libcairo2-dev, libsqlite3-dev
      and libnss3-dev when using system versions of those libs
  * Disable gconf support on >= 12.04
    - update debian//rules
    - update debian/mozconfig.in
  * Refresh binary dependencies:
    - Drop psmisc and fontconfig depends. We don't use any binaries
      from either of these packages
    - Drop debianutils dependency. This is an essential package
  * Introduce a branch config file (debian/config/branch.mk) which holds
    settings which shouldn't be merged between branches (eg, whether
    the crash reporter should be enabled)
    - add debian/config/branch.mk
    - update debian/rules
  * Move debian/locales.* to debian/config
    - move debian/locales.shipped => debian/config/locales.shipped
    - move debian/locales.unavail => debian/config/locales.unavail
    - update debian/rules
    - update debian/build/refresh-supported-locales.pl
  * Move debian/mozconfig.in to debian/config
  * Move debian/testsuite.mk to debian/build
  * We need to keep the complete list of language packs (shipped and
    transitional) in sync between branches. However, this was proving to be
    difficult because the list was split across 2 files (locales.shipped
    and locales.unavailable). Rework this so that we have a locales.all
    (containing the list of current and past language packs), and a
    locales.shipped. The locales.all can be easily kept in sync between
    branches now, so we end up with the correct transitional language packs
    on branches which have some languages disabled. This also makes it
    more complicated to add the language packs to debian/control though, so
    we offload this to a new perl script now rather than trying to do it all
    in bash
    - add debian/build/dump-langpack-control-entries.pl
    - update debian/build/refresh-supported-locales.pl
    - add debian/config/locales.all
    - update debian/config/locales.shipped
    - remove debian/config/locales.unavailable
    - update debian/control
    - update debian/rules
  * Touch debian/control.in during clean to force a refresh of debian/control,
    so we can check if it is out-of-date and fail if it is
    - update debian/rules
  * Refresh patches:
    - update debian/patches/ctypes-callback-reentry-fix.patch
    - update debian/patches/theme-refresh-compose-toolbar-icons.patch
    - update debian/patches/theme-refresh-message-header-buttons.patch
  * Ensure that we get the correct package relationships depending on the
    target distro version
    - update debian/control.in
    - update debian/rules
    - refresh debian/control
  * Drop the mozilla-devscripts dependency. We were only using this for creating
    tarballs anyway. Instead, implement our own get-orig-source target, which
    also fixes some problems we were having
    - update debian/control.in
    - remove debian/moz-rev.sh
    - update debian/rules
    - remove debian/mozclient/mozclient.mk
    - remove debian/mozclient/thunderbird.conf
    - update debian/config/branch.mk
    - add debian/build/create-source.py
    - add debian/build/get-orig-source.mk
    - remove debian/mozclient/thunderbird-remove.binonly.sh
  * Drop the 'nobinonly' suffix from the version number. All this really does
    is make the version number longer without adding any useful information,
    because:
    - We don't strip all binary files as there are a lot remaining which are
      used by the test-suite (eg, images, fonts, videos, sqlite dbs, extensions)
    - Stripping binary files from the source tarball isn't the only change we
      make to it. We also merge in the upstream l10n data, but we don't
      indicate that in the version number
  * Don't error out whilst building the source package if cdbs isn't installed.
    This enables us to create source packages on lillypilly
    - update debian/rules
  * Keep a copy of shipped-locales outside of the embedded tar.bz2. This
    makes it faster to verify the list of shipped locales when creating
    source packages
    - update debian/build/create-tarball.py
    - update debian/build/extract-file.py
    - update debian/rules
  * When calling refresh-supported-locales, automatically refresh
    debian/control too
    - update debian/rules
  * Dropped patches fixed upstream:
    - remove debian/patches/theme-refresh-toolbar-and-tab-colours.patch
    - remove debian/patches/theme-refresh-smaller-resize-grips-1.patch
    - remove debian/patches/theme-refresh-smaller-resize-grips-2.patch
    - remove debian/patches/build-fix-for-no-ENABLE_YARR_JIT.patch
    - remove debian/patches/compile-pldhash-as-C++.patch
  * Don't fail to create the tarball if locales listed in all-locales don't
    really exist upstream. We already check that everything in shipped-locales
    exists
    - update debian/create-tarball.py
  * Pass --comm-rev to client.py when specifying a release tag
    - update debian/build/create-tarball.py
  * Don't fail to create a tarball when not using a local cache
    - update debian/build/create-tarball.py

thunderbird (7.0+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release (THUNDERBIRD_7_0_BUILD1)

  * Pass --enable-update-channel to configure on beta/aurora. Although we don't
    use the updater, this information does appear in crash reports, which is
    useful. We also use it in the Apport hook, and it will be used to enable
    testpilot on aurora/beta when it exists in the future
    - update debian/rules
    - update debian/config/mozconfig.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.install.in
    - update debian/apport/thunderbird.py.in

  * New upstream release from the beta channel (THUNDERBIRD_7_0b3_BUILD1)

  * Don't error out whilst creating the source package if mozilla-devscripts
    or cdbs aren't installed. This enables us to create source packages
    on machines which don't have these available
    - update debian/rules
    - update debian/mozclient/thunderbird.mk
  * Refresh shipped locales to add Bulgarian
    - refresh debian/locales.shipped and debian/locales.unavailable
    - refresh debian/control

thunderbird (7.0~b2+build2+nobinonly1-0ubuntu2) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 2.0.1
    - Fixes broken labels in the Edit menu
    - Fixes radio item siblings not always being correctly unchecked
  * Update messagingmenu-extension to 0.8
    - Fix a bug in inbox-only mode where we displayed non-inbox folders when
      clearing inbox-indicators
    - Add support for libunity6 ABI
    - Provide a utility module for loading libraries and binding symbols
    - Hide the internal implementation details from other chrome code
    - Fix some small memory leaks
    - Only destroy the IndicateServer on shutdown rather than when toggling
      the pref to disable the indicator, as recreating it seems to result in
      weird crashes. When disabling the indicator, just hide it (which doesn't
      work in any case)
    - Hide the prefs if the required libraries aren't installed
    - Fallback gracefully if the required libraries aren't installed
    - Trap all exceptions during initialization. Throwing exceptions in to a
      document load handler is bad, as it can prevent the entire UI from loading
  * Fix broken icon URI for the reply button in the message header (LP: #844606)
    - update debian/patches/theme-refresh-message-header-buttons.patch

thunderbird (7.0~b2+build2+nobinonly-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream release from the beta channel (THUNDERBIRD_7_0b2_BUILD2)
    - LP: #837557 and LP: #838322

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 2.0
    - Only update a menu in realtime if it's parent is opening. For all other
      times, just invalidate the menu. Avoids spamming dbus everytime
      something changes in the menu
    - When removing a menuitem from its parent, check that the index is
      in-bounds. Should fix a frequent crash on startup, although it doesn't
      explain how it gets in to that state in the first place
    - Add the ability to turn on debugging without building Firefox with
      debugging on
  * Add upstream patch to only add ENABLE_JIT=1 to CXXFLAGS if any of trace/
    method/yarr jit is enabled. Fixes a build failure on PPC
    - add debian/patches/only-add-ENABLE_JIT-to-CXXFLAGS-if-jit-is-enabled.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Add upstream patch to fix build failure with ENABLE_YARR_JIT=0
    - add debian/patches/build-fix-for-no-ENABLE_YARR_JIT.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Add upstream patch to work around a linker bug
    - add debian/patches/compile-pldhash-as-C++.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Don't pass an empty --mozilla-repo= argument to client.py when creating
    the source tarball without a local cache, as it totally breaks. This is
    why we've got rid of all this in nightly and aurora, so we can avoid
    such bandaids in the first place
    - update debian/mozclient/thunderbird.conf
  * Messagingmenu fixes:
    - Use the libunity5 ABI (LP: #839154)
    - Don't use QueryInterface on objects where we can't guarantee they
      implement a particular interface (LP: #826447)
  * Make sure that thunderbird-gnome-support actually depends on libunity5
    - update debian/rules
  * Update eds extension to r84 from 0.3 branch
    - fixes a shutdown crash
  * Use the latest eds libs for the contacts integration

thunderbird (7.0~b1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu3) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Fix LP: #833591 - ensure that the xpt typelibs are generated correctly
    at build. Also make sure that any failures in future are fatal, so we
    don't create a broken binary
    - update debian/rules
    - update debian/eds/build.sh

thunderbird (7.0~b1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream release from the beta channel (THUNDERBIRD_7_0b1_BUILD1)

  * Make sure we actually install the crashreporter and apport blacklist file
    for branches which use Breakpad
    - update debian/thunderbird.install.in
  * Drop the Mail/News reference in the desktop file - just set the name to
    "Thunderbird Mail". This needs translating for other locales though
    - update debian/thunderbird.desktop.in
  * Drop patches fixed upstream:
    - remove debian/patches/addressbook-de-rdf.patch

    - update debian/rules
  * Ensure we use DEB_BUILD_* and DEB_HOST_* consistently so that cross-
    compiling works
    - update debian/rules

  * Simplify thunderbird-dev.install a bit by installing everything in

  * Use $(MOZ_DISTDIR) rather than $(MOZ_OBJDIR)/dist in debian/rules.
    - update debian/rules
  * Fix jsreftest failures by setting the correct timezone and locale
    - update debian/testsuite.mk
  * Add ${misc:Depends} dependency to transitional language packs

  * Fix "format not a string literal and no format arguments" error

thunderbird (6.0~b3+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu2) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 1.9.2
    - fixes a regression which causes the menu to not build and potentially
      crash when encountering non-menuitem nodes, due to an uninitialized value

 -- Chris Coulson <chris.coulson@canonical.com>  Tue, 09 Aug 2011 23:51:50 +0100

thunderbird (6.0~b3+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream release from the beta channel (THUNDERBIRD_6_0b3_BUILD1)

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 1.9.1
    - Drop Firefox 4 and 5 compatibility
    - Drop the uIGlobalMenuLoader interface, as it never served any purpose
    - Rework how we synchronize attributes to menuitems from their
      corresponding command nodes
    - Don't synchronize attributes from command nodes associated with menus
    - Rework how we handle document insertion/removals. Rather than keeping
      our dbusmenu structure in sync at all times, and routing the events
      to the correct node in the tree, we just mark the menu as invalid and
      rebuild it from scratch next time it opens. This should reduce problems
      like LP: #821391
    - Honour the collapsed attribute. This solves a problem with multiple
      seprators appearing adjacent to each other in the greasemonkey menu
    - Store all booleans as PRPackedBool rather than PRBool
    - Add error checking around uGlobalMenuDocListener
    - Make uGlobalMenuDummy more robust, and use it as a fallback if the
      real menuitem fails to initialize. This should help reduce problems
      like LP: #831391
    - If a menu fails to build correctly, mark it invalid and stop processing
      document events on it (which should avoid the crash in LP: #831391)
    - Invalidate a menu if we fail to insert/remove a node whilst processing
      a document event (which should help avoid the crash in LP: #831391)
    - Make uGlobalMenu::CanOpen() respect the collapsed attribute
    - Allow more than one menu node to register as a listener for any DOM
      node. In the case of command nodes, these may be shared across multiple
      menu nodes, with each one interested in receiving events. Previously, we
      just erased the first listener if a second menu node tried to register
      (discovered after adding error checking around uGlobalMenuDocListener)
  * Update messagingmenu-extension to r66
    - add an inbox-only mode
  * Refresh shipped locales for new release
  * Ship the eds contacts integration extension, based on r80
    - add debian/eds/*
    - update debian/rules
    - update debian/thunderbird.desktop.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.dirs.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.install.in
    - update debian/control
  * Move the Unity depends to thunderbird-gnome-support, and make sure we only
    add them for oneiric builds
    - update debian/control
    - update debian/rules

thunderbird (6.0~b1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu2) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Revert an upstream change which switched the default optimization from
    -Os to -O3. The intention is that -O3 will be used for PGO builds and -Os
    used for non-PGO builds. -O3 increases the package size by over 3MB
    - add debian/patches/change-opt-back-to-Os.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Update globalmenu-extension to 1.8
    - Update for imgILoader changes in Firefox 8
    - Fix LP: #810489 - Inconsistent behaviour if extension is enabled
      after turning off the menubar, which will affect Lucid -> P upgrades
      once Lucid has a newer Firefox. document.loadOverlay() triggers a reload
      of localstore.rdf, which overwrites our changes to the UI to hide
      the Firefox button and bookmark button. Restore them when this happens
    - Fix LP: #800733 - Quick Filter Bar checkbox in Thunderbird menu is
      not marked as checked. On menuitems with command nodes, ensure we update
      the state on the correct node
    - Ensure we disconnect all signal handlers when a menu is destroyed.
      Should fix a SIGSEGV in uGlobalMenu::OnClose()
  * Enable nsIAbCard to be used from JS - required for the EDS contacts
    integration work
    - add debian/patches/expose-nsIAbCard-to-script.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Add translations for the messaging menu launcher entries
    - update debian/thunderbird.desktop.in
  * Update desktop file translations

thunderbird (5.0+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu5) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Update messagingmenu-extension to r56
    - Improve the overflow handling when we reach 6 indicator entries in
      the menu, by adding priorities to particular mail folders. Inbox
      folders get the highest priority, and folders with messages we consider
      to be interesting also get an elevated priority
    - Add support for showing the new-mail count in the Unity launcher
    - Handle the X-Priority header in mail messages to request attention
      for any messages with a high priority. We also cancel any attempt
      to request attention for messages with a low priority
    - Fix the ordering of shortcut entries in the messaging menu to match
      the order of those in the desktop file
  * Fix LP: #806041 - Thunderbird crashes due to stack overflow. Cherry-pick
    patch from aurora
    - add debian/patches/stack-overflow-fix.patch

thunderbird (5.0+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu4) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Update globalmenu-extension to 1.7
    - Fixes LP: #797680 - "thunderbird -addressbook" and "thunderbird -compose"
      open a window without putting the menu in the panel, because the menu
      loader is started from the chrome overlay in the main window. Add the
      loader to the profile-after-change category instead
    - Fixes LP: #779905 - menubar sometimes appears inside the window rather
      than the panel, due to a startup race
  * Apply some changes to the messagingmenu-extension:
    - Ignore new messages in archive folders
    - Don't request attention for messages which aren't starred and aren't
      addressed directly to the recipient
    - Always show messaging indicator shortcuts, even when we have a desktop
      file which has them

    - Fixes LP: #766022

  * Switch to comm-miramar
    - update debain/mozclient/thunderbird.conf
  * Update globalmenu-extension to 1.6
  * Align packaging with firefox:
    - rename debian/apport/blacklist => debian/apport/thunderbird.in
    - rename debian/control => debian/control.in
    - rename debian/thunderbird-dev.install =>
       debian/thunderbird-dev.install.in

    - added debian/thunderbird.dirs.in

    - added debian/thunderbird.lintian-overrides.in
  * Build language packs directly from the thunderbird source
    + Include compare-locales FIREFOX_5_0b1_BUILD1 from
      http://hg.mozilla.org/build/compare-locales. It's needed for merging
      en-US strings with incomplete locales
    + Pull l10n data in to tarball from bzr
      - update debian/mozclient/thunderbird.conf
    + Configure build for creating language packs by configuring with
      "--with-l10n-base="
      - update debian/mozconfig.in
    + Store the list of locales to ship, and provide a way of automatically
      generating that list and the control file entries from the upstream
      source. Also provide a way to blacklist languages. We map languages
      to package names using langpack-o-matic (and also get descriptions
      from there too)
      - update debian/rules
      - add debian/locales.shipped
      - add debian/control.langpacks
      - add debian/control.langpacks.unavail
      - update debian/control
      - add debian/locales.unavailable
      - add debian/refresh-supported-locales.pl
    + Add common-build-indep hook to build the translation xpi's
      - update debian/rules
    + Add common-binary-post-install-indep to install the xpi's in to the correct
        debian packages
      - update debian/rules
      - add debian/get-xpi-id.py
    + When rebuilding debian/control in the clean target, fail the build
      if the control file was out-of-date. This ensures that we don't
      accidentally drop language packs, and forces me to maintain an
      up-to-date control file in bzr
      - update debian/rules
  * Rewrite the launcher script to not wrap around the upstream start
    scripts, but start the Thunderbird binary directly. The upstream start
    scripts contain a lot of complexity for dealing with things that we don't
    need to worry about, and are quite slow. Also, add in the hooks for the
    new profile migrator
    - update debian/thunderbird.sh.in
  * Replace the old profile migrator. The previous one relied on hard-coded
    values and fragile shell script that isn't really scalable enough
    now that stable Ubuntu releases see new major Thunderbird versions. The
    new profile migrator doesn't require any hard-coded values, and should
    be lower maintenance
    - add debian/migrator/xulapp-profilemigrator
    - remove debian/migrator/main.c
    - update debian/rules
    - update debian/thunderbird.sh.in
    - update debian/control.in
  * Build with "make -f client.mk" and using a mozconfig, rather than the
    autoconf/configure/make steps used previously. The client.mk contains the
    sequencing for doing PGO builds
    - add debian/mozconfig.in
    - update debian/rules
  * Add cairo LCD filter patch from Firefox
    - add debian/patches/cairo-lcd-filter.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Refreshed patches:
    - update debian/patches/fix-sdk-bin-install.patch
    - update debian/patches/no-dynamic-nss-softokn.patch
    - update debian/patches/unity-globalmenu-build-support.patch
  * Provide a single global pref file rather than adding a global pref
    folder for random applications to drop files in to. This means we
    can drop an additional distro patch
    - remove debian/patches/add_syspref_dir.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
    - rename debian/thunderbird.js => debian/syspref.js
    - update debian/syspref.js
    - update debian/thunderbird.install.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.postinst.in
    - update debian/thunderbird.preinst.in
  * Support running the Mozilla test suite at build time. Currently, we run
    the following targets: check, jstestbrowser, xpcshell-tests, reftest,
    crashtest and mochitest. Not enabled yet
    - add debian/testsuite.mk
    - update debian/rules
  * Don't touch $LIBDIR/.autoreg on install or removal. This has no effect
    with the components registration changes in Gecko >= 2.0
    - update debian/thunderbird.postinst.in
    - remove debian/thunderbird.prerm.in
  * Fix LP: #709216 - Clicking on a link doesn't open the page. Use
    GIO for external URI handling now
    - add debian/patches/default-uri-handler-check-use-gio.patch
    - add debian/patches/fix-nsGIOService.patch
    - add debian/patches/add-uri-handler-methods-to-nsIGIOService.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Use GIO for the default mailer check
    - add debian/patches/default-mailer-check-use-gio.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Backport patch from mozilla-central to fix powerpc build failure
    - add debian/patches/powerpc-build-fix.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Fix build on PPC64
    - add debian/patches/update-assembler-excl-arch-list.patch
    - update debian/patches/series
  * Ensure that the files in /etc/thunderbird/profile are cleaned up on
    upgrade
    - update debian/thunderbird.preinst.in
  * Drop unneeded patches:
    - drop debian/patches/bz420391_attXXXX_fix_unix_installer.patch (only
      seemed to be needed for static builds)
    - remove bz532198_lp488354_ns_invokebyindex_not_thumb2_safe.patch
      (fixed upstream)
    - remove debian/patches/bz591331_att469858_breakpad_allow_ptrace.patch
      (fixed upstream)
    - remove debian/patches/bzXXX_ftbfs_static_with_system_hunspell.patch
      (not doing static builds now)
    - remove debian/patches/bzXXX_linker_flag_ordering.patch (not doing
      static builds now)
    - remove debian/patches/fix_installdir.patch (not sure what it was
      needed for)
    - remove debian/patches/fix_sdk_install_mimecrypt.patch (fixed upstream)
    - remove debian/patches/lp682742_arm_it_instruction.patch (fixed
      upstream)
    - remove debian/patches/lp_710648_arm_it_instruction_breakpad.patch
      (fixed upstream)
    - remove debian/patches/use-MOZ_APP_LAUNCHER-for-launcher-exec.patch
      (fixed upstream)
    - update debian/patches/series 
  * Fix LP: #767115 - use a high-res icon for the launcher
    - update debian/thunderbird.links.in

thunderbird (3.1.9+nobinonly-0ubuntu3) natty; urgency=low

  * Update globalmenu-extension code to 1.0
    - Fix LP: #755701 - When iterating over each label, check if the current
      character equals the access key (to set a flag indicating we've already
      seen it) *before* we mangle the label, rather than after it. 
      This fixes an issue where we never set the flag, and subsequently see
      the mnemonics repeated multiple times in labels
    - Also remove the hack we had to add placeholder entries to empty menus
      so that we could get an about-to-show signal (now that LP: #619811
      is fixed)

 -- Chris Coulson <chris.coulson@canonical.com>  Mon, 11 Apr 2011 01:15:49 +0100

thunderbird (3.1.9+nobinonly-0ubuntu2) natty; urgency=low

  * Update globalmenu-extension code to 0.7
    - Fixes LP: #749440 - Interaction with CuteButtons extension makes
      Thunderbird abort with icons in menus. Work around this by ignoring
      icons greater than 100x100 to avoid DoS'ing unity and dbus-daemon with
      lots of icon data
    - Fixes LP: #734837 - Some menu items are not displayed. Some menuitems
      inherit a label from their command content node rather than having a
      label attribute on the menuitem content node. Make sure we use the 
      right label in this case
    - Make the Alt key show the menubar in the panel
    - Drop the hacks we had to workaround the lack of menu closed signals from
      Unity. We no longer synthesize our own menu closed events, but use the
      proper event from dbusmenu.
    - In addition to this, we split the work done during menu opening in to
      2 phases - the first phase triggered off "about-to-show" and the second
      phase triggered off "opened". In the future, we should be able to delay 
      the menu opening with the about-to-show handler, which is where we
      do all the work to update the menu

  * Fix LP: #719919 - no option for Thunderbird as default mail client
    - update debian/thunderbird.desktop
  * Disable the default mail client check. This seemed to always be the
    intent, but the wrong preference was being set. We correctly set
    mail.shell.checkDefaultClient to false now. This check doesn't work in
    Natty and isn't going to work unless I get time to backport gio support
    to 3.1
    - update debian/thunderbird.js

    calling the linker. The static archives mostly depend on things in LIBS,

  * fix LP: #526290 - Thunderbird 3 hyperlinks broken; installing
    the thunderbird-gnome-support package does not trigger component
    re-registration. This caused users that install thunderbird-gnome-support
    after first run without gnome integration until they upgrade/reinstall
    thunderbird main package. We fix this by adding a postinst.in/prerm.in
    for the -gnome-support package that touches $PKGLIBDIR/.autoreg to trigger
    component reregistration on next start.

    appropriate paths to a fresh thunderbird-dev.install package.
    - update debian/rules
    - add debian/thunderbird-dev.install

    /usr/include/nspr (and nss-config and /usr/include/nss) to the tbird sdk if
    system nspr/nss is used
    - update debian/rules
  * fix build failures on hardy-jaunty; DEB_MAKE_EXTRA_ARGS doesnt exist in the
    cdbs versions available there; using DEB_MAKE_ENVVARS is supposed to work
    everywhere; hence we use that to set INSTALL_SDK
    - update debian/rules

    != xulrunner; we work around by patching toolkits packager.mk to install them

  * fix LP: #137221 - thunderbird-gnome-support package required for
    gnome capabilities; the gnome parts were always loadable modules and
    fail to load gracefully if depends cannot be fulfilled anyway; in turn
    we ship gnome components in the main thunderbird package and apply a bit
    magic in debian/rules to strip the gnome related dependencies from it;
    on top of this thunderbird-gnome-support becomes an empty package which gets
    all the dependencies for convenience; the purpose of new gnome-support is
    hence to install all required depends; in order to add the required depends
    to the gnome-support package we introduce a new substvar "shlibs:GnomeShlibs"
    and refer to it in control

  * Merged from Debian unstable; new upstream version.
  * Remaining differences between
    Debian and Ubuntu in no particular order:
    - Build libnspr and libnss and corresponding -dev packages from this
      source package.  Plus changes to make these libs build nicely.
    - Various changes to preferences, default bookmarks and search engines.
    - Support for `Get Help Online' and `Translate This Application'.
    - Size changes for various dialogue boxes to make the contents fit.
    - Downloads go to separate `Desktop' folder by default.
    - Fix some underquoted m4 arguments.
    - Minor changes in directories, symlinks and debian/control
      to cope with Ubuntu and Debian's different histories.
    - disable File / Import (wizard is nonfunctional).
      Malone #28563, Debian #350599, Mozilla Bugzilla 117844.
    - Change `Latest Headlines' to `Latest BBC Headlines' to properly
      disclose the source up front, and use a corresponding RSS URL.
    - Default for FIREFOX_DSP is none.
    - Pango support is enabled only if an installed locale seems to need
      it.
    - Note in README.Debian about how to run xpcshell.
    - Disable xprint.
    - No build dependency on libxp-dev; build-depend on zip instead.
    - Various icon changes.
    - Some currently-unused directory merging code in firefox.preinst.
    - Less detail in the user agent string.
    - Belt-and-braces removal for some cruft left over by some versions of
      the Mozilla build system.
    - Better firefox.menu entry (says `Firefox Web Browser').
    - Build dynamically linked, since in Ubuntu embedders use firefox.
    - EbmedWindow::GetVisibility bugfix, Malone 40320, upstream 312998.
    - Pass FC_ANY_METRICS to Fontconfig where appropriate.
    - Extensive Thai language patch.
    - Print in serif by default even though default display is sans.
    - Some fixes to the (upstream-unused) nss makefiles.
    - Strip PostScript/ from printer names.
    - Better message about updates of read-only extension.
    - Include pointer to the Gecko Runtime (GRE registration).
    - Prevent websites from disabling context menus.
   All of these changes are fully documented in the changelog below.
   Please see those changelog entries for full details.  Much historical
   information about changes either taken up by Debian or upstream, or
   dropped by us, is retained in this changelog.

firefox (1.99+2.0b2+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release.

  * extensions/inspector/build/src/Makefile.in,
    extensions/inspector/build/src/inspector.pkg,
    extensions/inspector/build/src/nsInspectorModule.cpp: Removed, the problem
    was lying in debian/rules. /me goes hiding under a rock.
  * layout/inspector/public/Makefile.in: Reverted previous changes.
  * debian/rules: Don't exclude inspector files when dh_installing the firefox
    package. We need the inspector.xpt file from the components directory. The
    files for the dom-inspector package are already excluded from the
    firefox.install file anyway.
  * debian/firefox-dom-inspector.install,
    debian/firefox-dom-inspector.links: Simplified.
  * debian/control:
    + Turn firefox-dom-inspector into an arch: all package, since the binary
      component has been merged into the firefox binary.
    + Adjust dependencies for binNMU safety.
  * xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/Makefile.in, configure.in, configure:
    Use ${host_cpu} instead of uname -m so that firefox can safely build on
    s390x with a s390 target, and on amd64 with an x86 target.
  * uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsGNOMERegistry.cpp,
    uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsGNOMERegistry.h,
    uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsOSHelperAppService.cpp,
    uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsMIMEInfoUnix.cpp,
    uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsMIMEInfoUnix.h: Adapted patch from bz#273524 to
    make helper applications with parameters work. (Closes: #355511)
  * debian/copyright: Adjusted with updated information for firefox 2.0, which
    is now properly tri-licensed \o/. (Closes: #330295)
  * debian/rules: Install the MPL file taken from the upstream LICENSE file.

    the firefox binary despite -Wl,--as-needed in the LDFLAGS.
    (Closes: #378667)
  * debian/firefox.install: Don't install xpt_link, xpt_dump, xpidl,
    xpicleanup, xpcshell nor regxpcom. They are of no use to firefox users and
    are provided with xulrunner anyway. (Closes: #362190)

      doesn't understand them. (Closes: #382080)
  * editor/libeditor/text/nsPlaintextEditor.cpp: Apply patch from
    bz#271815 to fix OverTheSpot mode used by many Asian language input
    modules. (Closes: #379935)

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=high
 
  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * New upstream release. Urgency high because it fixes MFSA 2006-44 to
    MFSA 2006-56 excluiding MFSA-2006-49. (Closes: #380463)
  
  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/firefox.prerm: Remove /usr/lib/firefox/.autoreg instead of
    /var/lib/firefox/.autoreg.
  * browser/app/profile/extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}/install.rdf.in:

  * xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/unix/xptcinvoke_linux_alpha.cpp: Removed
    useless new line that showed up in the diff.gz.

firefox (1.99+2.0b1+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta targetted at experimental:
    - Much better search plugins handling. They can be added and removed at
      will, and even better, system-wise search plugins can be ignored at the
      profile level. (Closes: #352195, #320957, #296425, #308005)
  * browser/components/shell/src/Makefile.in: Correctly install the
    setDefaultBrowser component.
  * config/rules.mk: Don't install extensions in the chrome.
  * debian/firefox.links: Link /usr/lib/firefox/dictionaries to
    /usr/share/myspell/dicts.
  * config/autoconf.mk.in, configure, configure.in: Add the
    --enable-system-myspell argument to configure to use the system myspell
    library.
  * extensions/spellcheck/myspell/src/Makefile.in: Use the system myspell
    library when asked to.
  * debian/rules:
    - Add --enable-system-myspell to configure call.
    - Do shlibsign libfreebl's (there can be several depending on the arch).
  * debian/control: Add libmyspell-dev to build dependencies.
  * browser/components/microsummaries/src/Makefile.in, config/Makefile.in:
    Add rules so that make clean cleans everything.
  * allmakefiles.sh: Removed references to nonexisting Makefiles in
    extensions/xmlextras/base.
  * configure, configure.in: Apply patches from bz#334866, bz#319012 and
    bz#335949 + fixups to workaround gcc visibility hidden bugs, especially
    #331460 (an instance of which is actually still present in C++,
    see gcc#26905).
  * extensions/inspector/build/src/Makefile.in,
    extensions/inspector/build/src/inspector.pkg,
    extensions/inspector/build/src/nsInspectorModule.cpp: Added missing files
    for the DOM Inspector component.
  * extensions/inspector/build/src/Makefile.in,
    layout/inspector/public/Makefile.in: Adapted so that the DOM Inspector
    component would build correctly and the xpt would be installed in
    the extensions directory.
  * extensions/reporter/Makefile.in: Install missing reporter's preference.

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low
  
  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * debian/control: 
    - Fix silly typo of binutils. (Closes: #378582)
    - Standards-Version to 3.7.2.1.
  
  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Use a specific LD_LIBRARY_PATH at link time so that we don't need to
      link against indirect dependencies. (Closes: #378378)
    - Run shlibsign after the files are stripped so that it is accurate and
      FIPS mode can correctly work.
    - Removed old commented out OPTFLAGS that were kept in case gcc 4.0 did
      no better than gcc 3.x.
    - Removed old exported variables that are useless nowadays.
    - Removed dh_strip call in binary-indep. Who wants to strip
      arch-independant files ;)
  * debian/presubj: Added notes about plugins and crash reports.
  * security/manager/Makefile.in, security/nss/cmd/shlibsign/Makefile:
    Don't build nor install the .chk files but still build shlibsign.
  * debian/firefox.install: Don't install .chk files since we generate them
    after dh_strip.
  * security/nss/cmd/shlibsign/manifest.mn: Don't build in shlibsign/mangle.
    It doesn't build anyway.

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * netwerk/base/public/security-prefs.js: Disable SSLv2 by default. I
    thought the weak cipher warning took care of this. (Closes: #371153)
  * debian/firefox-runner: Simplify the dsp autodetection and add aoss to
    the roster. (Closes: #372848)
  * firefox-restart-required.update-notifier, firefox.postinst,
    firefox.install: Add update-notifier to indicate that firefox needs to
    be restarted on upgrade. Based on Ian Jackson's patch, but reworked a
    little. Also with a bad French translation. Translators, assemble!
    (Closes: #365865)
  * config/rules.mk, debian/control: Apply patch from Thiemo Seufer to
    remove mips -xgot hack and build depend on the appropriate binutils on
    mips and mipsel. (Closes: #374372)
  * debian/presubj, debian/README.Debian: Add a bit more information about
    disabling Pango, which often seems to be the source of problems.
  * debian/firefox-runner: 
    - Print out MOZ_NO_REMOTE in verbose mode.
    - Fix some unreachable logic, Thanks Daniel Jacobowitz.

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Fix for Gecko date extraction from client.mk.
    - Disabled strict aliasing from optimized builds.
    - Added -Wl,--as-needed to the LDFLAGS, so that we don't get indirect
      libraries linked.
  * config/static-config.mk: Add MOZ_XFT_LIBS to STATIC_EXTRA_LIBS. It used to
    get linked as a side effect of linking to indirect libraries, but should
    be linked directly since Xft symbols are used.
  * debian/firefox-restart-required.update-notifier: Fixed the french
    translation. ;)
  * content/html/content/src/nsGenericHTMLElement.cpp,
    content/html/content/src/nsHTMLInputElement.cpp,
    dom/src/base/nsGlobalWindow.cpp: Fixed crasher and potential crashers.
    Reported bz#343953.

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Post-DebConf Hangover" release.
  
  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * New upstream release. Fixes various security issues. MFSA 2006-31 to
    MFSA 2006-43, excluding MFSA 2006-40.
  * debian/control:
    - Standards-Version to 3.7.2.0.
    - Set priority of -dbg to extra and Section to devel.

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * Applied distclean patch from xulrunner (in
    debian/patches/01_distclean.dpatch), except for the javaxpcom stuff we
    don't build anyway.
  * browser/app/profile/extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd},
    config/static-rules.mk: More cleaning for firefox.
  * nsprpub/configure: Apply change to nsprpub/configure.in.
    (Closes: #350616)
  * gfx/src/gtk/nsFontMetricsPango.cpp: Some more changes so that it
    actually builds without errors, and use PR_Malloc and PR_Free instead
    of malloc and free.

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=critical

  * The "secure enough for ya!" release.
  * New upstream release. Contains security fixes, hence severity
    critical. 
    - Fixes CVE-2006-1993 aka MFSA 2006-30. (Closes: #364810)
  
  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * security/manager/Makefile.in, debian/firefox.install: Build and
    install the .chk file again. That will make the FIPS mode work again.
  * debian/control: Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.0.0. No changes.
  * debian/rules: Fix the navigator.ProductSub value for dumb scripts.
    Closes: #364640, #365099. We now use the date of the client.mk file,
    which is likely to be the closest value to the release date, instead of
    useless build date.
    Add the debian version after the firefox version string.
  * debian/rules: Use dpkg-architecture to find out the host and build that
    we want to pass to the configure script. (Closes: #365738)

  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * debian/firefox-runner: 
    - Quote the APPLICATION_ID variable to handle profiles with a space 
      in the name. Inspired by Morita Sho's patch. (Closes: #364566)
    - echo MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO on verbose.
  * debian/rules: It's baaaackkk. Reenable xprint.

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Thai-related crash fix (Malone 45395):
    - nsCopySupport.cpp, nsCopySupport::HTMLCopy:
       do not crash if htmlConverter->Convert fails.
    - nsHTMLFormatConverter.cpp, nsHTMLFormatConverter::Convert:
       properly report failure if dataStr.IsEmpty.
    - nsJISx4501LineBreaker.cpp: fix printf(stderr -> fprintf.
  * Add Polish translation for firefox.desktop (Malone 45447).
    Thanks to contribution from Tomasz Dominikowski.
  * Do not attempt to merge /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox and /usr/lib/firefox
    and make the former a link to the latter; this is unfortunately
    error-prone and makes more problems than it solves.
    Fixes Malone 44487; regresses the plugins directory confusion bug.
  * Include MFSA and CVE numbers in changelog entry for 1.5.dfsg-1.

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix memory leak in large clipboard handling.  Malone 41093.
    Mozilla Bugzilla 289897; applied attachments 218749, 218753.
  * Provide symlink /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox -> /usr/lib/firefox
    (and shuffle stuff across if both directories exist).
  * Remove update-notifier `restart required' on removal so that if you
    remove firefox you're no longer asked to restart it.  Malone 36739.    
  * Increase size of prefs window explicitly.  Malone 43528.
  * Suppress the error if /var/lib/locales/supported.d/* can't be read
    (probably because it doesn't exist).  If you get EIO or EACCES or some
    such then having pango mysteriously disabled will be the least of your
    worries.  Malone 44016.
  * Really use firefox_1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3.orig.tar.gz from Debian.

    MFSA 2006-30, CVE-2006-1993: Deleted
     object reference when designMode="on" 
    This package is based on Debian's firefox_1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3.orig.tar.gz

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=critical

  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * New upstream release. Contains security fixes, hence severity
    critical.
    - Fixes the following vulnerabilites (Thanks Alexander Sack for 
      compiling the list): CVE-2006-1724, CVE-2006-0884, 
      CVE-2006-1730, CVE-2006-1729, CVE-2006-1728, CVE-2006-1727,

      CVE-2005-2353. (Closes: #362656)
  * debian/firefox-runner: Patch from Paul Collins to fix some lingering
    ProfileManager launch issues. (Closes: #356250)
  * browser/components/preferences/privacy.xul,
    browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/preferences/preferences.dtd:
    Patch from Ian Jackson to make the preferences window bigger for
    people with high rez displays. His changelog entry reads:
    * Make Preferences window not chop off various elements:
      - specify a width of 50em instead of 42em
      - do not specify a height
      - add another <separator/> to the bottom of privacy.xul's prefpane.
        I have no idea why this is necessary :-(.
      Malone 36985.
  * configure.in, configure: Small typo in configure.in that wasn't
    setting TARGET_XPCOM_ABI properly and breaking binary extensions on
    some arches. (Closes: #359228)

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/rules: Disable elf-dynstr-gc, which is pretty useless nowadays.
  * security/coreconf/rules.mk: Fix perl code that got broken by newer make.
    Taken from bz#325148.
  * browser/app/Makefile.in: Apply patch from bz#314927 to install default.xpm
    in the correct place.
  * debian/rules, debian/firefox.dirs, debian/firefox.install: Updated to fit
    this change.
  * security/coreconf/rules.mk: Force use of the -g flag in the CFLAGS.

  * Increase sizes of various dialogue boxes so that all of the contents
    fit.  Malone 26225, 36985, and probably others.
  * Set MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO=1 to disable pango, unless some locale is
    selected as supported which would need pango for rendering; the
    default can be overridden by setting MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO to 0 or 1.
    Malone 32561 (workaround).

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.2-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, 1.5.0.2.
    Described as `stability and security fixes' by upstream but many
    changes are included and producing a complete list is infeasible :-(.
    Fixes are known to be included for:
    - MFSA 2006-29, CVE-2006-1725: Spoofing with translucent windows

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Add -g to the build flags when building with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip.
      If we ask for nostrip, we want the debugging
      symbols, right? ;)
    - Changed the way we identificate ourselves in vendor.js.
  * layout/build/Makefile.in, layout/build/nsLayoutModule.cpp: Remove useless
    useragent setter at startup so that general.useragent.product and
    general.useragent.productSub set in our vendor.js preference file work at
    startup time.
  * security/coreconf/Linux.mk:
    - Patch from Martin Michlmayr for mips64 builds.
    - Don't use x86 as CPU_ARCH when building on an unsupported architecture.
  * security/manager/Makefile.in, security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/Makefile,
    security/nss/lib/manifest.mn: Don't build the stuff we don't need, and
    dynamically link libnssckbi to both libplc4 and libplds4 instead of
    linking statically.
  * debian/firefox.postinst, debian/firefox.prerm,
    debian/firefox-gnome-support.postinst, debian/firefox-gnome-support.prerm:
    Touch a .autoreg file at configure time, or removal of gnome-support and
    remove it with the package. This will trigger autoregistration of the
    components if the compreg.dat and xpti.dat files are older than the
    .autoreg file. We used to remove compatibility.ini for that reason, but
    stopped doing that because firefox was supposed to do that correctly,
    which actually only correctly works on new upstream versions, not new
    debian revisions, or installation of gnome-support.
  * xpfe/components/killAll/Makefile.in: Correctly install the killAll
    component.

  [ Eric Dorland ]
  * debian/control:
    - Set Section of firefox-gnome-support and
      mozilla-firefox-gnome-support to gnome.
    - Standards-Version to 3.6.2.2.
    - debhelper build-dep to >= 5.0.
    - Add firefox-dbg package.
  * debian/compat: Set to 5.
  * debian/rules:
    - Remove silly CVS tarball cleanup target.
    - Add arch-independant debhelper calls, and make other debhelper
      calls arch-dependent.
    - Add --dbg-package=firefox-dbg to dh_strip call.
    - Always build with the -g flag. (Based on a change Mike made)
    - Patch from Andreas Jochens to use -mminimal-toc when building on 
      ppc64. (Closes: #361035)
    - Use --disable-strip, --disable-strip-libs in configure parameters.
      Thanks Ian Jackson.
    - Use .upstream instead of .orig to make it more clear and not  
      confuse the clean target. Thanks Ian Jackson. (Closes: #362186)
    - Disable xprint support for now, while the Xorg 7 transition sorts 
      itself out. Should be reenabled next release.
  * debian/firefox.xpm: Add more Debian compliant menu icon.
  * debian/firefox.install, debian/rules: Install new Debian compliant
    icon.
  * debian/firefox.desktop: Add StartupNotify=true for pretty waiting
    cursor. Thanks Sven Arvidsson. (Closes: #361527)
  * debian/firefox-dom-inspector.preinst,
    debian/firefox-dom-inspector.links,
    debian/firefox-dom-inspector.install: Install non-architecture
    specific bits of the inspector into /usr/share/firefox.
  * debian/firefoxrc: Disable the dsp wrapper by default. esddsp is just
    too buggy to allow this to continue. May reenable later if they clean
    up their act. Leaving the bugs open for now.
  * debian/firefox.NEWS: 
    - Document the dsp wrapper changes.
    - Remove old mozilla-firefox entries.
  * debian/firefox.1: Fix typo of firefox, thanks Andrew Rendle. (Closes:
    #362413)
  * debian/firefox.install: We don't get .chk files anymore for some
    reason.

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * modules/libpref/src/init/all.js: Set default fonts for all languages to

  * Replace Ubuntu Bugzilla bookmark with Launchpad's `Request

  * Reinstate `Translate This Application' in Help menu, despite the fact
    that Launchpad doesn't do this yet - you just get a page saying there
    are no translations for Firefox.  mdz assures us that this will be
    done some time during dapper's service life.

  * Fix md5sum mismatch which causes spurious conffile prompt on
    bookmarks.html.
  * Set browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone to ignore,

    firefox looks like it has lost your home page because it is so keen to
    tell you about the release notes.  (Malone 33895.)

  Bookmark, search and translation reference regression fixes:
  * Restore `Translate This Application' and `Get Help Online'
  * Add Ubuntu and Free Software links back to bookmarks
  
  Bookmark, search and translation references improvements:
  * Add Wikipedia to search box.
  * Remove `Quick searches' from bookmarks (these just replicate

  * Add rpath setting for /usr/lib/firefox to all .pc files in
    firefox-dev.  This is suboptimal, but at least it allows programs

  * Take some redundant and perhaps privacy-leaking information out

firefox (1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.1-1ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  Changes since 1.5.dfsg-4ubuntu6:
  * New upstream version (1.5.0.1) - security and stability fixes,
    allegedly. (About 7000 lines of diff, so not reviewed for Ubuntu.)
    Security fixes included:
    - CVE-2006-0292, CVE-2006-0293, MFSA 2006-01: JavaScript garbage-collection
      hazards
    - CVE-2006-0294, MFSA 2006-02: Changing position:relative to static
      corrupts memory
    - CVE-2005-4134, MFSA 2006-03: Long document title causes startup denial of
      Service
    - CVE-2006-0295, MFSA 2006-04: Memory corruption via QueryInterface on
      Location, Navigator objects
    - CVE-2006-0296, MFSA 2006-05: Localstore.rdf XML injection through
      XULDocument.persist()
    - CVE-2006-0297, MFSA 2006-06: Integer overflows in E4X, SVG and Canvas
    - CVE-2006-0298, MFSA 2006-07: Read beyond buffer while parsing XML
    - CVE-2006-0299, MFSA 2006-08: "AnyName" entrainment and access control
      hazard
  * Fix Norwegian translation in .desktop file.  (Malone #30603.)
  * mkdir /usr/include/mozilla in firefox-dev.preinst to avoid
    maintainer script sometimes preventing installation.
  * Move the shlibs needed for gtkmozembed to /usr/lib (avoids
    need for rpath and nonsense in firefox-gtkmozembed.pc).
  * Work around new GNU make braindamage by adding seddery to
    security/coreconf/rules.mk.

  Expected-permanent differences between Ubuntu and Debian:
  * Build nspr and nss for use by all other programs in the distribution
    (Packages: libnspr-dev, libnss-dev, libnspr4, libnss3.  Fairly main
    changes to parts of the build system.)  This is so that mozilla
    can be in Ubuntu universe.
  * Disable xprint.  (xprint is not used in Ubuntu.)
  * Slightly different arrangements do with with transitional arrangements
    related to package renaming from mozilla-firefox-*.
  * Removed transitional packages mozilla-firefox-dom-inspector and
    mozilla-firefox-gnome-support (not needed in Ubuntu).
  * Build firefox-dev; applications which embed a browser in Ubuntu
    generally embed Firefox rather than mozilla.  This also means that we
    build firefox with dynamic linking so that embedders and load ff.
  * Debian package search replaced by Ubuntu package search (and defaults
    to searching only in dapper, not all releases).
  * Changes to various icons (and their installation paths).
  * Strip CUPS/ from the front of displayed printer names, since
    all printing in Ubuntu is done via CUPS.

  Other differences remaining between Ubuntu and Debian:
  * debian/rules clean removes various junk left over by the mozilla build
    system.  (Debian #350616.)
  * Exclude libssl3.so from dpkg_shlibdeps as this triggers a bug in
    fakeroot on amd64 in Ubuntu.
  * Set FIREFOX_DSP=none by default.  Will sometimes break sound from eg
    Flash.  See https://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/29760 for rationale.
    (Debian maintainers notified but no bug filed.)
  * Append our plugin path to any previous value of MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH.
    (Malone 29412.  Debian #351806)
  * firefox.desktop file has more translations and consistently calls the
    application `Firefox Web Browser' (for better UI in the menus - this
    change is also in firefox.menu).  Debian #351807.
  * Default printing command doesn't break if printer name contains
    spaces (actually a preference, in all.js).  (Debian #351809,
    Mozilla Bugzilla #326245). 
  * security/coreconf/rules.mk adjusted with awful seddery to cope with
    GNU make change to POSIXly interpretation of backslash line-joining.
    See http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00988.html.
    Mozilla Bugzilla #325148.
  * security/coreconf/ruleset.mk has a set -e added.
  * Use GNOME mime database instead of mailcap.  Patch imported from Red
    Hat; see debian/gnome-mime-handling.diff.

  [ Mike Hommey ]
  * debian/presubj: Added indications to try to reproduce without extensions
    before actually filing a bug, and a hint to the safe mode.

    from Steve Langasek to fix unused vs. used gcc attribute on alpha and
    arm. (Closes: #325535)
  * browser/app/profile/firefox.js: Revert patch to remove the "I'm
    feeling lucky" search. Some like it, some hate it, so upstream
    behaviour wins. If you still feel strongly about it, make your case
    upstream.
  * gfx/src/gtk/nsFontMetricsXft.cpp: Apply patch from bz#252033 to work
    around a bug in XRender that might be causing #319349.

mozilla-firefox (1.0.99+deerpark-alpha2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Sync with unstable branch changes, except the controversial "I'm feeling
    lucky" change. I prefer waiting for the controversy to get to a
    conclusion.
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Remove build dependency on libmng-dev and
    the --with-system-mng option to configure, the MNG support has been
    removed upstream.
  * debian/rules: Explicitely set the svg-renderer as cairo. It will use an
    old cairo version bundled with firefox, but there's no other solution for
    the moment. We have to wait for upstream 0.9.x and greater support
    (hoped for 1.5).

  * browser/app/profile/firefox.js: removed the "I'm feeling lucky" from

    you will be presented with search results and not taken to the first
    result. Thanks Torok Edwin. (Closes: #321823)

  * New upstream alpha release. Be aware that you WILL have troubles with
    debian packages for firefox extensions.
  * Reverted patches that got incorporated upstream.
  * content/events/src/nsEventStateManager.cpp: Some changes to the previous

  * debian/mozilla-firefox-dom-inspector.install: Only install files from

  * debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs: Don't create /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/*,
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions nor /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.install:
    - Don't install regxpchrome, chrome/pipnss.jar and chrome/help.jar which
      don't exist anymore.
    - Install manifest files in addition to jar files in chrome.
    - Install classic.jar in the normal chrome directory (awaiting EM
      modifications so that it can actually go back in the extensions
      directory).
    - Don't install debian/theme/00classic and debian/theme/Uninstall,
      which got removed.
    - Get the theme in the correct directory (it's not in
      defaults/profile/extensions anymore).
    - Install the reporter extension.
    - Selectively install subdirectories of /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults,
      since some of them are useless.
    - Install the unixprint plugin.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.manpages: Removed manual page for
    update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.links: Removed all links in
    /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/.
  * debian/rules:
    - Enable freetype in the build, we'll see if deerpark is any better than
      1.0.x.
    - Commented out OPTFLAGS set for some architectures. We will see if gcc
      4.0 is doing any better.
    - Enabled SVG support. (Closes: #215990)
    - Enabled some more extensions to fit extensions provided by upstream.
    - Added needed --enable-application=browser to the ./configure call.
    - Don't install update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
    - Don't create installed-chrome.txt.
    - Don't remove installed-extensions.txt, it doesn't exist anyway.
    - Don't move classic theme's install.rdf, it's already at the correct
      place.
    - Remove unneeded removals of preferences files which are not there
      anymore.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst: Clean-up old generated files (those in
    /var/lib/mozilla-firefox and
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/*/uninstall/Uninstall. (Note that for
    the latter, some packages do provide them, but they were overwritten by
    update-mozilla-firefox-chrome. They have actually no use, and it is safe
    to remove them. Extensions packages will eventually remove them anyway)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: Put -depth option of find before -type d.

      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/components.ini. That way, we only rebuild it
      after an update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
    + Detect if we're being run through sudo without the -H option, in which
      case we force setting of $HOME. (Closes: #218156)
  * browser/app/profile/firefox.js: Sync'ed with debian/firefox.js.
  * toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in:
    + Removed some error messages that get there because firefox is trying to
      write in the /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox directory as a user. They are
      useless and lead users to think something is going wrong while it's the
      (stupid but) normal way firefox works.
    + Avoid creation of directories when attempting to read files, that
      throwed uncaught exceptions breaking some stuff in several different
      ways when extensions don't follow the new scheme for extensions.
    + Avoid copying stuff from
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/ to
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/, that's the *very* old way of
      installing extensions, which, since the old scheme has been thrown away,
      won't work anyway, if any extension provides files out there.
    + CheckForMismatches: Avoid to disable already disabled global extensions,
      and don't propose to upgrade the locked extensions. That fixes a
      never-ending loop occuring when running firefox for the first time in a
      user account, while some global extensions are expired.
      (Closes: #278722, #281537)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm, debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst: Moved
    removal of links to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/
    sitting in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/, if any remaining, from
    prerm to preinst. We remove them once and for all, they won't be created
    by us anymore.
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome:
    + Removed support for extensions in
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/.
    + Removed some clean-up that had been introduced to help the Extensions
      Manager not to die, and which, actually, did not work out quite so well.
      Anyways, with the changes this time, the EM is supposed to support much
      more problems than ever before (as usual ;) ) so we don't need that
      anymore.
    + Avoid stupid mv error messages when firefox-bin -register fails (which
      is not supposed to happen, but you're never too careful)
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome, debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst:
    Move removal of some very old stuff to preinst, to do it once and for all
    instead of doing it every time we run update-mozilla-firefox-chrome.
  * netwerk/protocol/ftp/src/nsFtpConnectionThread.cpp: Applied patch from
    bz#124561 to get a prompt for username/password in case anonymous login
    fails.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner:
    + Added check for more arguments so that the url in the command line get
      detected more accurately.
    + When a file name is given on the command line, prepend "file://" and
      change spaces into %20. (Closes: #281800)

  * Changes by Eric Dorland
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: Patch from Philipp Weis to fix order of
    find arguments. (Closes: #280852)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.desktop: Support new mime type handler in Gnome
    2.8. (Closes: #281274) (MH: I added some more myme-types)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.postinst: Run update-desktop-database if it
    exists.
  * widget/src/gtk/nsWidget.cpp: We don't use gtk anymore, might as well
    revert these patches. Thanks Stephane Despret.

    - debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs: Removed creation of
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}/chrome,

    - browser/app/profile/extensions/{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}/install.rdf.in:

    - debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs: Removed creation of the directory.

      installed-chrome.txt, excluding inspector and classic theme stuff,

      /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/chrome.d related stuff.

      extensions that fail to install chrome.

    - debian/mozilla-firefox.links: Add a symlink for Extensions.rdf 
      and components.ini, from /usr to /var.
    - debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: Don't remove files we don't

      update-mozilla-firefox-chrome into the package.

  * Move preferences back into /usr:
    - debian/rules: Don't move the prefs into

      as well, and remove firefox-l10.js file.

    - toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in: Added 
      a hook so that defaults/syspref gets registered in defaults.ini 
      after all other extensions preferences.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.preinst: only clean-up stuff if we are

mozilla-firefox (0.99+1.0RC1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner:
    - Fixed to run properly with dash. (Closes: #279549).
    - Fixed indentation.
    - Added a basic debugger support.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.1: Added information about debugger options.
  * debian/rules: Added a debug option to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. If you want to
    build a fully gdb'able package, use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="noopt nostrip
    debug"
  * netwerk/protocol/ftp/src/nsFtpConnectionThread.cpp: Apply new patch from

    - Further change this patch to use Append rather than AppendLiteral,
      which doesn't seem to exist. (ED)

mozilla-firefox (0.99+1.0RC1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * netwerk/protocol/ftp/src/nsFtpConnectionThread.cpp: Apply patch from
    bz#266835 to fix anonymous user password issue. (Closes: #226784)
  * toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in: (MH)
    - Fully apply previous patches, which for some reason left a spurious code
      line which made the extensions manager not like expired extensions
      anymore. (Closes: #279140)
    - Enhanced extensions manager so that the behaviour described in
      https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247846#c14 *actually*
      works. Extensions packagers are invited to move their chrome files
      accordingly, and remove /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/chrome.d files so that
      extensions chrome don't get registered when they are forced-disable due
      to version mismatch or some other reason.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner: 
    - Fix some thinkos. (MH)
    - Fix for loading files from the command line. (Closes: #279018) (MH)
    - Removed setting --display from $DISPLAY, let it get it from the 
      environment, but pass --display if it is set. (Mike, 
      I'm worried this will screw up some session 
      managers, let me know what you think, we can revert it)
    - Removed FIREFOX_OPEN_IN stuff, so that firefox now obeys to "open 
      links from other applications in" setting. (Closes: #279073) (MH)
    - Enhanced command line parsing, and drop empty arguments. 
      (Closes: #279138) (MH)
    - No need for a find to look for XUL.mfasl, we already have its 
      location from the path list taken from profiles.ini. (MH)
    - Better detection of dsp wrapper, when FIREFOX_DSP=auto. 
      (Closes: #254611) (MH)
    - Correctly open local files even when firefox was not previously 
      running. (Closes: #279018) (MH)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.1: (MH)
    - Removed references to FIREFOX_OPEN_IN.
    - Added the -safe-mode option.
  * debian/mozilla-firefoxrc: Removed FIREFOX_OPEN_IN. (MH)

mozilla-firefox (0.10.1+1.0PR-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: (MH)
    - Use upstream extensions set. This will eventually get a
      correct help menu and fix some yet undiscovered UI issues. 
      (Closes: #257946)
    - Added support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt.
    - Changed OPTFLAGS assignment.
    - Remove whitespace characters in version number for UserAgent
      branding.
    - Install mozilla-firefox-runner into /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/firefox
      (Closes: #278477)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.links: (MH)
    - Link /usr/bin/firefox and /usr/bin/mozilla-firefox to 
      /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/firefox.
    - Removed obsolete profile/US links.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.dirs: Create /etc/mozilla/profile instead of
    /etc/mozilla/profile/US. (MH)
  * toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp: Fix crash in nsCmdLineService::Initialize
    when argc is changed by gtk (when treating gtk specific arguments)
    (MH)
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-runner (Changes by MH):
    - Removed workaround for bug #122990. First, xmlterm is not an activated
      extension, and secondly, if it still requires the TERM environment
      variable, it is the user's duty to set it to whatever he wants, not
      firefox's start script's.
    - Removed the ulimit -c setting. First, it is set by default to 0 on a
      newly installed debian, and secondly, it is user's choice to set it or
      not if he needs to get core files.
    - Removed unused shell variables.
    - Removed unsetting AUDIODEV variable. If it still crashes, it does belong
      to some other code than firefox. The AUDIODEV environment variable is
      used nowhere in firefox code:
      http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/search?string=AUDIODEV
      Note that there is a "A crash which occurred when AUDIODEV doesn't
      contain "/" was fixed." log message in esound version 0.2.33 changes and
      that the bug may have belonged there.
    - Replaced ${HOME}/.mozilla-firefoxrc file by a ${HOME}/.mozilla/firefox/rc
      file. The former is still supported, though, but will bring a warning
      message. If both are present, only the latter is taken into account.
    - Changed the way system and user FIREFOX_DSP and FIREFOX_OPEN_IN
      variables are handled. First, use system values defined in
      /etc/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-firefoxrc, then override with
      ${HOME}/.mozilla/firefox/rc and then with runtime environment variables.
    - Don't die when DISPLAY is not set. Display can be passed by --display
      option, and if not set and needed (some options don't require it),
      firefox will complain.
    - Some shell code simplifications by using some coreutils.
    - Added better command line parsing.
    - Added verbosity mode.
    - Removed setting of FONTCONFIG_PATH, /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/res/Xft
      doesn't exist
    - Factorized localization detection.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.1 (MH):
    - Made some clean-up between dashes and hyphens.
    - Removed obsolete options and added new ones.
    - Added informations about some debian specific stuff.
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome: Changed the way we move files to
    /var/lib/mozilla-firefox. It will avoid creating files with a * in their
    name whenever registration failed. (MH)
  * debian/README.Debian: Update java instructions, tell them to just use
    java-package.

  * This release mostly courtesy Mike Hommey. 
  * layout/src/xul/base/src/nsImageBoxFrame.*: Backported patch from
    bz#255372. (Closes: #278046)
  * toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in: Force locking

    files to be unexpectedly removed by firefox.
  * debian/control: Add Mike Hommey as an Uploader.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.install: Removed content-packs.jar which is
    mozilla-browser specific.

    /chrome directory so that preview is shown in the Themes Manager. Yes,
    this is stupid, but it is the way firefox wants it (and it's not even
    created by make install, nor in the official binary tarball. It is
    only created at run time, but you know what ? under *nix, a normal
    user can't create that directory) (Closes: #276404)

    the debian package version to the UserAgent. (Closes: #268654)

    Hommey)

  * Port all of Mike's changes to my local CVS.

mozilla-firefox (0.9.3-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non Maintainer Upload for RC Fixes.
  * Applied changes to toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in
    and toolkit/mozapps/extensions/locale/extensions.properties to solve some
    issues with extensions management. (taken from CVS)
  * Applied other changes to
    toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in,
    toolkit/mozapps/extensions/public/nsIExtensionManager.idl and
    mozilla/toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp to be able to use -register
    instead of -list-global-items for extensions/components/chrome
    registration through update-mozilla-firefox-chrome, thus not needing
    Xvfb anymore (-register option doesn't require a X server).
    (taken from CVS)
  * Applied some more changes to
    toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in in order to
    avoir overlayinfo deletion during extensions registration process.
    (taken from CVS)
  * Final changes to toolkit/mozapps/extensions/src/nsExtensionManager.js.in
    to avoid registering out of date extensions so that firefox doesn't enter
    a loop at startup when no profile was found, and to only write in the
    installed-extensions-processed.txt file the list of actually installed
    extensions. Note that for packaged extensions installing their files
    directly into the chrome or components directories, that only means they
    won't appear in the Extensions Manager. They will still be available in
    the GUI.
  * All these fixes improve the Extensions Manager. Closes: #259046.
  * accessible/src/atk/nsAccessibleWrap.cpp,
    accessible/src/atk/nsAccessibleWrap.h: fixed 32-bit abuse of gobject
    (Steve Langasek). Closes: #259836.
  * debian/control: Removed dependency upon xvfb.
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome:
    + Removed use of Xvfb.
    + Removed creation of a root default profile, but kept the fake home
      hack to avoid creation of a .mozilla directory in root's home.
    + Changed extensions handling so that the overall process is cleaner.
      Extensions packages will have to move extensions {uid} directories
      to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/, while the current location
      is still supported for compatibility purpose (but is strongly not
      recommended).
    + Removed use of regxpcom and regchrome, since what they both do is
      done by firefox-bin -register.
  * debian/rules: force GnomeVFS support to be disabled. (Josselin Mouette)
  * debian/README.Debian:
    + Added a note about potential problems with packaged "old" extensions.
    + Added a note about how to manually disable packaged extensions in user
      profile.
    + Removed some old notes that don't apply anymore.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox-dom-inspector.install, debian/rules: Move
    extensions files to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/ instead of
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.links: Move installed-extensions.txt symlink
    from /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/defaults/profile/extensions/ to
    /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions/.
  * debian/mozilla-firefox.prerm: More cleanup on removal of package.

  * Ok, I was wrong, we're still in experimental. I think we need to fix a

    make sure the hacky extensions mechanism is more bullet-proof.
  * debian/rules: --disable-installer, since we don't use it.
  * debian/update-mozilla-firefox-chrome:

    - Capture return values from reg* commands on error, stolen

    - Remove returns from check_running.
    - Pull in snippets from /var/lib/mozilla-firefox/extensions.d 
      to generate installed-extensions.txt for new extensions mechanism.  
    - An insane hack, but necessary because of upstream: Launch a Xvfb 
      to run firefox to generate the necessary extension metadata. I've
      been told this will not be necessary in the next version.

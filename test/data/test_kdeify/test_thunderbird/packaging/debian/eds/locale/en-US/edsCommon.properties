CannotDeleteDirectoryTitle=Cannot delete address book
CannotDeleteDirectory=Sorry - this version of EDS Contacts Integration does not support deleting Evolution address books. Due to the way that Thunderbird tries to delete address books, all of your EDS address books will appear to be removed from the address book manager.  Simply restart Thunderbird in order to have them return.

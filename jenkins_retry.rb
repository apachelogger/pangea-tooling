Usage: jenkins_retry.rb [options] 'regex'

regex must be a valid Ruby regular expression matching the jobs you wish to
retry.

Only jobs that are not queued, not building, and failed will be retired.
  e.g.
    • All build jobs for vivid and utopic:
      '^(vivid|utopic)_.*_.*'
    • All unstable builds:
      '^.*_unstable_.*'
    • All neon applications
      'bionic_release_applications_[^_]+$'
    • All jobs:
      '.*'

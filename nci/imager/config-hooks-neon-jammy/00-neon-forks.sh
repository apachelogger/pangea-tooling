# build-hook but runs before live-build and thus allow us to preempt
# ambiguous errors by using incorrect components.

# When one of these isn't form us it likely means it has gotten outscored

# All CI builds force the maintainer to be neon so this is a trivial way to
# determine the origin of the package without having to meddle with dpkg-query
# format strings and the like or going through apt.

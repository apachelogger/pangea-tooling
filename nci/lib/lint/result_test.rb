# FIXME: we manually load the reporter here because we install it from git
#   and would need bundler to load it properly, alas, bundler can't help
#   either because in containers we throw away gemfile and friends on
#   account of only using ci-tooling/
#   Ideally we'd simply have the gem updated properly so we don't need
#   git anymore.
